# Snippet Samples 

You can [download samples](https://tinyurl.com/pwdp-smpls) from Google Drive.

Place them in the directory of your choice & remember to set up variable `ext_samples_path` that points to this 
directory. Example

    # Load My Samples
    ext_samples_path = 'e:/hopbit/dj/samples'
